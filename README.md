ML-Based Firewall
=================

An intelligent, machine learning-powered firewall that detects and blocks malicious network traffic in real-time. This project uses data-driven models to enhance traditional firewall capabilities by learning from traffic patterns and identifying potential threats automatically.

Features
--------
- Real-time packet analysis
- Machine learning-based threat detection
- Visual dashboards for monitoring
- Automatic blocking of suspicious IPs/domains
- Continuous model updates with new data

Technologies Used
-----------------
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch (customize as needed)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scapy / Tshark (for packet capture)
- Flask / FastAPI (for dashboard or API integration)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Getting Started
---------------

Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and the following packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Firewall

    python src/firewall.py

Training the Model (optional)

    python src/train_model.py --input data/traffic.csv

Example
-------
- Detects DDoS attacks
- Blocks IPs based on anomaly scores
- Flags suspicious DNS queries
